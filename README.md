# education-inequality
Using R to explore correlations between Census and school data and examine how socioeconomic factors might show education inequality in the US.

## Data
This project utilizes two data sets. The primary data set is the EdGap data set from EdGap.org. This data set from 2016 includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools, sourced from each state’s department of education, and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district, from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.

## Analysis
The analysis for this project is done in R. The workflow in `Education Inequality Project.Rmd` contains the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling (polynomial regressions & subset selection), analysis of performance, and discussion.
